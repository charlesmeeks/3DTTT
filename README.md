# 3DTTT

Prototype implementation of a 3‑D Tic‑Tac‑Toe game. The center cube acts as a wildcard counted for both players.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (only used for development tooling):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Open `src/index.html` in a modern browser. No local server is required because dependencies load from a CDN.

## Gameplay

Click a cube to place the current player's piece. Red moves first. Rotate the board with the mouse. When three pieces align in any direction (including across planes), a victory message appears.
